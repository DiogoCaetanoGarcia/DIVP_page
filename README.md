The Digital Image and Video Processing (DIVP) Group was formed in 2006 at the [University of Brasilia](https://unb.br/). Its members include faculty members from the Departments of
[Computer Science](https://cic.unb.br/),
[Electrical](http://www.ene.unb.br/),
[Software and Electronic Engineering](http://fga.unb.br/), as well as graduate and undergraduate students.

The Group’s activities are centered around research and teaching in the areas of digital image and video processing, with the following major research areas.

## [Point clouds](https://diogocaetanogarcia.github.io/DIVP_page/point-clouds/)

  <i>Plenoptic point cloud</i><br>
</p>

Point clouds are 3D representations of real-world objects, people and scenes, which can be conveyed in real time to remote locations, enabling free-viewpoint viewing and rich collaboration as if all parties were co-located. The Group has developed
[compression technology](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/ieee_tip_raht3d.pdf)
that is currently adopted by MPEG’s
[Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) standard](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8571288)</a>.
Other research topics include:

* [Plenoptic point cloud coding](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/ieee_tip2018_plenopticpc.pdf)
* [Geometry coding](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8957232)
* [Super resolution](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/icip2018_tiagoSR.pdf)
* [3D saliency maps](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/MMSP2020_vitor.pdf)

## [Image and video compression](https://diogocaetanogarcia.github.io/DIVP_page/video-compression/)

The Group started researching several aspects of image and video compression, such as:

* [Encoding complexity](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/jcis2015tiago.pdf)
* [Wyner-Ziv coding](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/tcsvt_bruno_2009.pdf)
* [Scanned document compression](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6476018)
* [Intra prediction](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/spl_diogo_intrapred.pdf)
* [Motion estimation](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/MMSP2017_motion.pdf)

Furthermore, our work on [non-rectangular](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/icip06wedge.pdf) [block partition](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/icip09wedgeme.pdf) was later adopted by the [AV1 open video coding standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1).

</p>

Besides image and video compression, our Group has also developed a large array of image and video processing technologies, such as:

* [JPEG compression history estimation for color images](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/neelsh-journal.pdf)
* [Face-spoofing detection](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/ieee_tifs_face_spoofing.pdf)
* [Multibeam echo sounder data compression](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/rioacoustics17_comp.pdf)
* [Automated non-contact heart rate measurement using conventional video cameras](https://biblioteca.sbrt.org.br/articles/548)
